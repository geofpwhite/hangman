WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains the source code for my senior project.

You can check it out at 

https://geofpwhite.github.io/hangman 

The goal is to create a web page that allows me and my friends to play hangman together. 

In order to avoid polling and to allow for users to see each others actions in real time, 
a persistent websocket connection is opened whenever a user joins the game. 

If you notice a problem or have an idea let me know !
